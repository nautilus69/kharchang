This Shiny app visualize the sound with kandinsky like pictures.

you may have to convert yourmusic.mp3 to test.wav with ffmpeg command:

ffmpeg -i yourmusic.mp3 test.wav 

then copy this into your music folder and run the app.

I used Kandinsky package for converting fourier series to a kandinsky-like painting. more information for this package is on their own repo: https://github.com/gsimchoni/kandinsky
